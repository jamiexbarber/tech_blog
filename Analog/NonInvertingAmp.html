            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>
                An ideal non-inverting op-amp takes a DC (or AC) signal and amplifies the signal based on the gain set 
                by two resistors, similar to an inverting op-amp. Unlike the inverting op-amp, the input resistance to the op-amp 
                is set by the input resistance inherent to the op-amp.
                <br />
                The input resistance to the two input terminals to an op-amp is usually set by MOSFET transistors which
                have a very high input resistance (due to the gate oxide, an insulation layer, between the gate and the 
                channel, there is a further discussion on the MOSFET basics page).  
                <br />
                The first resistor (R1) is connected to the inverting terminal to ground and the second
                resistor (R2) serves as feedback resistor connected to the inverting terminal as well, right before
                (R1). The input voltage goes into the non-inverting terminal. 
                <br />
                The output resistance is ideally zero, and unlike with the gain of the inverting op-amp, there is no phase shift to worry about for the gain.
            </p>
            <h3>Can you help me derive the transfer function?</h3>
            <p>
                We'll define the transfer function as simply the ratio of the output voltage (Vout) relative to the
                input voltage (Vin) i.e. the gain. (There will be a more detailed discussion on transfer function on the Bode plot and filters page)
                <br />
                To derive the transfer function (gain) for the ideal non-inverting op-amp, we will use
                Kirchoff's Current Law, which says the current flowing into a node must equal current flowing out 
                of a node. We will also take advantage of familiar assumptions we can make when working with ideal op-amps,
                shown in the equations below:
                <br />
                <div class="IdealOpAmpEqs">

                        <br />
                        <figcaption> Two Ideal Op-Amp Assumptions </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                The first assumption says the input resistance to each terminal is so high, that we can assume
                there is no current flowing into either terminal.
                <br />
                The second assumption says the voltage difference between non-inverting termainal and the inverting
                terminal is close to zero. We can assume the voltage at both terminals (+) and (-), are the same. 
                This is assumption is also called a virtual ground.
                <br />
                With this assumptions we can write the following equation which says the current flowing through R1
                is the same as the current flowing the (R2). Note in this derivation, feedback current is flowing from
                the output to the input terminal. Now, we'll solve for the gain.

            <h3>If the virtual ground didn't exists, what can designers do to help minimize the voltage drop between V<sub>+</sub> and V<sub>-</sub></h3>
            <p>
                The virtual ground is the idea that the non-inverting terminal and the inverting terminal
                have the same voltage potential (or very close). You can read more about it <a href = "AnalogHomepage.html/#virtualground">here</a>. 
                Note that virtual ground is an assumption made for <em>ideal</em> Op-Amps. In reality, the two terminals are not exactly the same
                and differ from each other by some voltage offset. We will consider input and output voltage offset in a later article.
                <br />
                For now, consider the additional current that the negative terminal would see, just by being connected to two resistors. We can offset that
                additional current (which leads to the additional voltage potential) by adding a third resistor.
                <br />
                If we assume both R1 and R2 are tied to ground, together they would have an equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel.
                We could place that equivalent resistance at non-inverting terminal, as R3. Below are two examples of how to configure with each Op-Amp.
                Just be careful about the size of R3 relative to the input bias currents of the Op-Amp, if the resistor is too large,
                adding it in may wreck Op-Amp performance.
                
                <!-- where to put R3 picture? -->

            <h3>What applications is the non-inverting op-amp well-suited for?</h3>
            <p>
                Inverting op-amps are well-suited for applications where a designer needs a really high input impedance, which can particularly helpful
                when considering voltage buffers. A typical voltage buffer is simply R1 set to open and the feedback resistor
                set to a short. Voltage buffers help transfer the maximum amount of voltage (and therefore power) on to the next stage
                in a circuit system. They help do this through a larger input resistance (very little current, so very little voltage drop)
                and a very small output resistance (as much current as possible transfers over)
