            <h2>Non-Inverting Op-Amp</h2>
            <!-- image -->
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>
                An ideal non-inverting op-amp takes a DC (or AC) signal and amplifies the signal based on the gain set 
                by two resistors, similar to an inverting op-amp. Unlike the inverting op-amp, the input resistance to the op-amp 
                is set by the input resistance inherent to the op-amp.
                <br />
                The input resistance to the two input terminals to an op-amp is usually set by MOSFET transistors which
                have a very high input resistance (due to the gate oxide, an insulation layer, between the gate and the 
                channel, there is a further discussion on the MOSFET basics page).  
                <br />
                The first resistor (R1) is connected to the inverting terminal to ground and the second
                resistor (R2) serves as feedback resistor which is connected to the inverting terminal as well, right before
                (R1). The input voltage goes into the non-inverting terminal. 
                <br />
                The output resistance is ideally zero, and unlike with the gain of the inverting op-amp, there is no phase shift to worry about for the gain.
            </p>
            <h3>Can you help me derive the transfer function?</h3>
            <p>
                We'll define the transfer function as simply the ratio between the output voltage (Vout) and the
                input voltage (Vin) i.e. the gain. (There will be a more detailed discussion on transfer function on the Bode plot and filters page)
                <br />
                To derive the transfer function (gain) for the ideal non-inverting op-amp, we will use
                Kirchoff's Current Law, which says the current flowing into a node must equal current flowing out 
                of a node. We will also take advantage of familiar assumptions we can make when working with ideal op-amps,
                shown in the equations below:
                <br />
                <!-- substack image of two equations,(1) virtual ground (2) no current flowing in-->
                The first assumption says the input resistance to each terminal is so high, that we can assume
                there is no current flowing into either terminal.
                <br />
                The second assumption says the voltage difference between non-inverting termainal and the inverting
                terminal is close to zero. We can assume the voltage at both terminals (+) and (-), are the same. 
                This is assumption is also called a virtual ground.
                <br />
                With this assumptions we can write the following equation which says the current flowing through R1
                is the same as the current flowing the (R2). Note in this derivation, feedback current is flowing from
                the output to the input terminal. Now, we'll solve for the gain.

            <h3>Why is no current inser?</h3>
            <p>
                The virtual ground is the idea that the non-inverting terminal and the inverting terminal
                have the same voltage potential (or very close). To understand the root of this assumption, we'll
                introduce another ideal characteristic, very large open-loop gain. Open-loop gain is gain inherent to 
                the op-amp, it's the gain of the op-amp without the feedback resistor (R2) connected. It's usually on
                the order of 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup>.
                <br />
                This type of gain from open-loop would lead to op-amp instability if left unchecked. Designers use negative feedback
                (connecting the output to the inverting terminal through a feedback resistor (R2)) to stabalize the amplifier
                and ensure the output voltage is within the available range (as supplied by the + and - power supplies or the rails)
                <br />
                Negative feedback in combination with, near-infinite open-loop gain, helps ensure the inverting terminal stays close in value 
                to the non-inverting terminal. This can proven mathmatically as well with the op-amp equivalent circuit (or the small-signal circuit).

                find or create the equivalent circuit and point out the relevant equation with substack

            <h3>What applications is the non-inverting op-amp well-suited for?</h3>
            <p>
                Inverting op-amps are well-suited for applications where a designer needs a really high input impedance, which can particularly helpful
                when considering voltage buffers. A typical voltage buffer is simply R1 set to open and the feedback resistor
                set to a short. Voltage buffers help transfer the maximum amount of voltage (and therefore power) on to the next stage
                in a circuit system. They help do this through a larger input resistance (very little current, so very little voltage drop)
                and a very small output resistance (as much current as possible transfers over)
