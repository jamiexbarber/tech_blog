            <h2>Inverting Op-Amp</h2>
            <!-- image -->
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>
                An ideal inverting op-amp takes a DC (or AC) signal and amplifies it based on the gain set 
                by two resistors. The input resistance to the op-amp is set by an input resistor (R1). The
                output resistance is ideally zero. The gain comes with a 180 degree phase shift.
            </p>
            <h3>Can you help me derive the transfer function?</h3>
            <p>
                Transfer function is language that comes from analyzing circuits in the frequency domain.
                We'll discuss this in more detail when we discuss Bode Plots and filters. For now,
                consider the transfer function as the ratio between the output voltage (Vout) and the
                input voltage (Vin), or put more simply, the gain.
                <br />
                To derive the transfer function (gain) for the ideal inverting op-amp, we will use
                Kirchoff's Current Law, which says current flowing into a node must equal current flowing out 
                of a node. We will also take advantage of some assumptions we can make when working with ideal op-amps,
                shown in the equations below:
                <br />
                <!-- substack image of two equations,(1) virtual ground (2) no current flowing in-->
                The first assumption says the input resistance to each terminal is so high, that we can assume
                there is no current flowing into either terminal.
                <br />
                The second assumption says the voltage difference between non-inverting termainal and the inverting
                terminal is close to zero. We can assume the voltage at both terminals (+) and (-), are the same. 
                This is assumption is also called a virtual ground.
                <br />
                With this assumptions we can write the following equation which says the current flowing through R1
                is the same as the current flowing the (R2). Then solve for the gain.

            </p>
            <h3>Why is the virtual ground a valid assumption?</h3>
            <p>
                The virtual ground is the idea that the non-inverting terminal and the inverting terminal
                have the same voltage potential (or very close). To understand the root of this assumption, we'll
                introduce another ideal characteristic, very large open-loop gain. Open-loop gain is gain inherent to 
                the op-amp, it's the gain of the op-amp without the feedback resistor (R2) connected. It's usually on
                the order of 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup>.
                <br />
                This type of gain from open-loop would lead to op-amp instability if left unchecked. Designers use negative feedback
                (connecting the output to the inverting terminal through a feedback resistor (R2)) to stabalize the amplifier
                and ensure the output voltage is within the available range (as supplied by the + and - power supplies or the rails)
                <br />
                Negative feedback in combination with, near-infinite open-loop gain, helps ensure the inverting terminal stays close in value 
                to the non-inverting terminal. This can proven mathmatically as well with the op-amp equivalent circuit (or the small-signal circuit).

                <!--find or create the equivalent circuit and point out the relevant equation with substack-->
            </p>
            <h3>What applications is the inverting op-amp well-suited for?</h3>
            <p>
                Inverting op-amps are well-suited for applications where a designer needs control
                over the input impedance into the op-amp. This may be particularly relevant for noise calculations.
                Additionally, an inverting op-amp makes sense if a designer needs (or is willing to work with) a 180 degree phase shift in the output.
