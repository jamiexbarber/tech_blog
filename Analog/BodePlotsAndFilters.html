            <h3>Let's first do a refresher on Logarithms</h3>
            <p>
                Logarithmic scale can be a great alternative to linear scales when working with very large
                or very small changes in one trend, and no particularly big changes in a second trend; a log scale
                <br />
                Below are two figures, the red signal has drastic changes, and the blue signal has more moderate changes.
                The figure on the left has a linear scale for both the x- and y-axis, the right figure has a log scale for the y-axis only (semilog graph).
                <!--Add figures-->
                <br />
                In the discussion below we're going to highlight the following log rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>log(10) = 1 (when the base is not specified, we will use base 10)</li>
                    <li>log(1000) = 3 </li>
                    <li>log(1) = 0</li>
                    <li>log(1/2) = -0.3 <a href = "https://www.rapidtables.com/math/algebra/Logarithm.html#quotient-rule">Log Quotient Rule</a> </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Bode Plot, and why is it useful?</h3>
            <p>
                A plot that shows the frequency response of a system. Through a Bode Plot we can understand the amplitude of system
                using the dB scale (log-based) as well as the phase of the system, measured in degrees.
                <br />
                The Bode Plot can give designers a sense the amount of gain (dB) they can expect from a system at various frequencies. As well
                as how much bandwidth they can expect from a system. The phase plots can help designers detect instability. 
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Transfer Function?</h3>
            <p>
                A Transfer function is a ratio of the output to the input of a system. It's a complex number that describes the amplitude as well 
                as the phase of a system as a function of frequency.
                <br />
                Below is an example of a transfer function for a single pole and single zero system.

            <h3>How does a Bode Plot relate to a Low Pass Filter?</h3>
            <!--we'll have a paragraph on 3db, cutoff frequency, unity-gain bandwidth, phase, DB, we'll include
            a waveform from an opamp at a sample frequency as well.-->
            <p>
                We can use an op-amp to filter out certain frequency ranges. As the name suggests, a low-pass filter, filters out 
                frequencies at high frequencies (frequencies beyond the cutoff frequency) and allows frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency to 
                pass through with minimal attenuation.
